# Android keyboard keyboard accessibility with form sheets

When opening a form sheet with Android (via keyboard), the keyboard focus should stay within the form sheet like it does on iOS. Also, when using `presentation: 'modal'`, the keyboard focus stays within the modal.

To test in Android emulator, use your keyboard to control the app (move with arrows, press buttons with spacebar).

On iOS, make sure you have Full Keyboard Access on in Accessibility Settings.
